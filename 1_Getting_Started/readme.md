To get started follow the below instructions.

1. Make a personal account at https://github.com/ with your @tamu.edu email.
Explanation: just do it.

2. Now go to: https://education.github.com/ to request free private repos.

Explanation: It may take several days, so apply as soon as possible.

3. Send me your GibHub ID, and I will add you in our GitHub QianLab orgnaizaiton account. 
Explanation: There are two types of accounts personal and organizational. If you completed step 2 correctly you will  have several private repos. The QianLab organization has a maximum of 20 private repositories.

4. Finally you will need some way to upload your files to GitHub. 
Explanation: There are two ways: command line and destop client. For those who are not familiar with command line, I suggest to using the GitHub deskop client https://mac.github.com/. Download and install this program. The first time you start the program you will be prompted to login. Once you have done this you can click on the + sight in the upper left hand corner to start a new repo. If you want to make changes to an existing repo go to the GitHub page of that repo and click on "clone in desktop".
